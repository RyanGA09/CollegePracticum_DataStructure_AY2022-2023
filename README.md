# College Practicum - Data Structure Second Half Semester (AY 2021 - 2022)

This project is part of the Data Structure course during the second half of the Academic Year 2021 - 2022. The focus of this project is to explore and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms using C/C++. The goal is to understand how data is organized, stored, and manipulated efficiently in memory. Students will be introduced to abstract data types (ADTs), pointers, and common structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues, as well as algorithms for sorting and searching. This practicum aims to enhance problem-solving skills and understanding of computational efficiency, preparing students to work with more complex data management tasks in real-world applications.

Throughout the practicum, students will apply theoretical concepts to practical programming exercises, developing a deeper understanding of data structure manipulation and algorithm optimization.

## Features
